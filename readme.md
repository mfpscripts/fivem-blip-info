# FiveM Blip Info Utility
by [**glitchdetector**](https://github.com/glitchdetector)

This resource aims to help implement the pop-up information window that appears when hovering over blips in GTA Online. It also serves as an example use of the newly discovered tech it's built upon.

This popup is only visible while in the pause menu map, and while hovering over a blip that has information attached to it.

All rendering and logic is handled by the resource.

This resource is a standalone utility, meaning:

 * It does not rely on a framework
 * It does nothing by itself
 * You as a developer need to utilize its exports
 * **If you are not a resource developer, this is not for you**
